# YAIM904 d01b – Compacted Entities 1x1 🧱

---

## 📦 Description

**YAIM904 d01b – Compacted Entities 1x1** creates **compact versions of many vanilla and modded entities**, reducing their footprint to **1×1 tiles** while preserving their original functionality.

This MOD is designed to dramatically reduce factory size, allowing extremely dense layouts without changing how machines behave internally.

Each compacted entity is a **separate item**, recipe, and technology (when applicable), leaving the original entities untouched.

---

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* New **1×1 compacted versions** of supported entities are added
* Original entities remain unchanged
* Compacted entities:

  * Occupy **only one tile**
  * Keep their original behavior and purpose
  * Have adjusted graphics, connections, and interaction points
* Each compacted entity is:

  * Crafted separately
  * Unlocked through its own technology (if the original had one)

No configuration is required from the player.

## 🧩 Use cases

* 🏗️ Ultra-compact factory designs
* 🧪 Testing and sandbox environments
* 🚀 High-density late-game bases
* 🧠 Creative and experimental layouts

---

## ⚠️ Warnings

* 🚨 This MOD **strongly breaks vanilla balance**
* 📐 Factory design constraints are largely removed
* 🔌 Some entities with complex connections may behave differently visually
* ❌ Not recommended for:
  * Vanilla-balanced playthroughs
  * Players seeking original spatial challenges
